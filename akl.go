// Package akeyless includes the generated Go SDK. This file shouldn't be
// removed, it allows us to use `replace` directive in root `go.mod` file.
// Without it, Go fails to recognize this folder as a valid Go package.
//
// Running `go generate` in `sdktest` package populates this package with
// actual SDK files which are used in tests.
